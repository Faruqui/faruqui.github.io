* **Hyperparameter Analysis For Image Captioning Based On Different Languages:**
  * **Technology:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow & Numpy. 
  * We analyzed different hyperparameter combinations for two state-of-the-art image captioning models based on different languages: Chinese, Bangla and English and 
  tried to find suitable combinations of hyperparameters with this analysis. This experiment was carried out under the supervision of

* **An Efficient Learning Rate System in Deep Learning:**
  * **Technology:** Python, PyTorch & Numpy. 
  *  We explored different Learning Rate scheduler fucntions and proposed five different learning rate scheduling to train any deep learning model. This project aims to help in 
choosing an optimum learning rate, which will acheive higher accuracy and reduce the time of convergence at an optimum point. 

* **2D Sketch Colorization Using GAN:**
  * **Technology:** Python, TensorFlow & Numpy. 
  *  Sketch colorization can be applied in many scenarios. Our project will mainly focus on the colorization of black and white comics and manga. This will make the content more immersive for the readers. 
It can also help artists get a feel for the colored version of their sketches.

* **Dementia Prediction Using Different Machine Learning Model:**
  * **Technology:** Python, Scikit-learn & Numpy. 
  * Our project can help the general public get an idea about the possibility of dementia in adult patients by simply inputting MRI data. 
 Hopefully, it will prompt the patient(s) to get early treatment for dementia and improve their life. 
 We used the "MRI and Alzheimers" dataset provided by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project. 
 We used this dataset to train SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, models. 
 We used accuracy, recall, AUC, and confusion matrix as evaluation metrics. 
 To improve our result, we fine-tuned all our models using the Grid Search method.
