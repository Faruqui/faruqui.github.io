# CSE115L: Programming Language I (Lab)

**Course Description:** This is the first course in the computer science programming and is required for all computer science and engineering majors. 
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of structured programming. Topics include fundamentals of computers and number systems, algorithms & flowcharts, 
fundamental programming constructs: syntax and semantics of a higher-level language, variables, expressions, operators, simple I/O to console and files, 
conditional and iterative control structures, functions and parameter passing, dynamic memory allocation; fundamental data structures: arrays, structures, 
strings and string processing; and testing and debugging strategies.

**Summer 2021:** [Lab Manuals](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ejYmTtiNRbWAWwF07ukn4C4BGZqBJ5x1?usp=sharing)

# CSE411: Advanced Database Systems (TA)
**Course Description:** Physical data organization, design and administration including schema, normalization and relational algebra, database implementation, network database, distributed database, database machines, DATA LOG and intelligent databases. This course also focuses on query optimization algorithms for various types of databases.

# CSE332: Computer Organization and Architecture (TA)
**Course Description:** This course introduces students to the basic concepts of computers, their design and how they work. It encompasses the definition of the machineâ€™s instruction set architecture, its use in creating a program, and its implementation in hardware. The course addresses the bridge between gate logic and executable software, and includes programming both in assembly language (representing software) and HDL (representing hardware).

# CSE215: Object Oriented Programming (TA)
**Course Description:** This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques of object oriented programming. Actual computer programs are constructed by apply object oriented programming concepts and using an OOP language. Java is primarily chosen as the programming language in this course. The following topics are covered in this course: Java syntax with elementary programming, primitive data types, strings, operators, statements, arrays and methods, introduction to OOP, classes and objects, constructor, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, file IO operations, handling exceptions in Java, GUI, multithreading, generics and related concepts.

# CSE331: Microprocessor Interfacing and Embedded System (TA)
**Course Description:** This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concept of microprocessor architecture and microprocessor based embedded systems. A basic idea of the internal and external architecture of the microprocessor 8086 will be provided followed by the physical pin diagram of microprocessor 8086. The course will also cover the other peripheral devices of a microprocessor based system i.e. RAM 6116, PIO 8255 Controller and 7-Segment Display. The course will then cover the programming languages for interfacing: Assembly language followed by Interrupt and data conversion algorithm. A brief introduction to the Microcontroller 8051 will also be provided.
